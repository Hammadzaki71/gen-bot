Version 2 is coming soon. This is an open source account generator bot.

## Features
- `/generate` command
- `/help` command
- Automatic `/stock` command
- Log channel
- Generator channel
- Generator role

## Installation
1. Delete `discord.py` if it is installed.
2. LinkGen will install `Pycord` automatically.
3. Accounts folder and files will be created automatically.
4. Put your configuration in `config.json`.
5. Start the bot with `python LinkGen.py`.

Make sure to invite the bot with `applications.commands` enabled in the URL generator from the developer portal. Otherwise, the slash commands will not work.

2. Create a `Free Gen` role and a `Premium Gen` role.
3. Create a generator channel.
4. Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed.
